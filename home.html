    <h1>Background</h1>
        <p>Roper v. Simmons was a Supreme Court case in 2005 that prohibited the death penalty if you were under the age of 18. The basis of the court case was whether or not it was constitutional to sentence a minor under the age of 18 to the death penalty after Christopher Simmons planned and committed capital murder. The defendant was arguing that the 8th Amendment protected minors against the death penalty since it would be a cruel and unusual punishment.</p>
    <h1>Christopher Simmons Background</h1>
        <p>When Simmons was still in a junior in high school and 17 years old, he planned out how to murder someone via breaking and entering, tying up a victim and throwing the victim off a bridge. Simmons and two of his friends met at 2am and two of them entered the home of the victim, Shirley Crook, and used duct tape to cover her eyes and mouth and bind her hands and then they drove to a state park, tied her hands and feet together using electrical wire and threw her over a bridge into a river. The next day, after the husband reported her missing and fishermen found her body, police received information about Simmons’ involvement and arrested him at his high school and charged him with burglary, kidnapping, stealing, and murder in the first degree.</p>
    <h1>Court Case</h1>
        <p>Since Simmons was 17 at the time, he was outside the criminal jurisdiction of Missouri’s juvenile court system, so he was tried as an adult. The state sought the death penalty as aggravating factors such as the murder was committed for the purpose of receiving money, avoiding, interfering with, or preventing lawful arrest of the defendant, and involved depravity of mind and was outrageously and wantonly vile, horrible, and inhuman. The jury recommended the death penalty after finding the State had proved each of the three aggravating factors submitted to it. Simmons obtained new counsel, who argued that Simmons had received ineffective assistance at trial and part of the submission was that Simmons was “very immature,” “very impulsive,” and “very susceptible to being manipulated or influenced.” </p>
    <h1>Supreme Court</h1>
        <p>Simmons filed a new petition for state postconviction relief, arguing the reasoning of Atkins (which stated executions of those with an intellectual disability is unconstitutional) established that the Constitution prohibits the execution of a juvenile who was under 18 when the crime was committed. The Missouri Supreme Court agreed and held that a national consensus has developed against the execution of juvenile offenders, as demonstrated by the fact that 18 states now bar such executions for juveniles, that 12 other states bar execution altogether, that no state has lowered its age of execution below 18. On this reasoning it set aside Simmons’ death sentence and resentenced him to “life imprisonment without eligibility for probation, parole, or release expect by act of the Governor.” Before the ruling that it was unconstitutional, some states allowed 16 and 17 eligible for capital punishment (The Associated Press). In a case 17 years earlier, Thompson v Oklahoma deemed that anyone 16 or 17, it was constitutional to give them the death penalty (U.S. Supreme Court).</p>
    <h1>Aftermath</h1>
        <p>After the Supreme Court ruled 5-4 that it was unconstitutional for a state to give the death penalty for anyone under the age of 18. The court cited scientific research that determined adolescent development had to be taken into account, even in violent murders since the juvenile offender’s objective immaturity, vulnerability, and lack of true depravity should require a sentence less severe than death. The emphasis on deterrence, incapacitation, and punishment resulted in the confinement of more youth in adult jails and prisons (Benekos and Merlo)</p>
