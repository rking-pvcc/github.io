<h1>Network & The Internet Terminology</h1>
        <table>
            <h3>Network Classifications:</h3>  
            <ul>
                <li>LAN -</li>
                <li>A Local area network (LAN) is a network that consists of a collection of computers in a single building or building complex.</li>
                <li>MAN -</li>
                <li>A metropolitan area network (MAN) is a network of intermediate size, such as one spanning a local community</li>
                <li>WAN -</li>
                <li>A wide area network (WAN) links machines over a greater distance - perhaps in neighboring cities or on opposite sides of the world.</li>
        </table>

        <table>
            <h3>Network Models:</h3>
                <ul>    
                    <li>Bus Network -</li>
                    <li>A bus topology is when the machines are all connected to a common communication line called a bus and is sometimes created by running links from each computer to a central location where they're connected to a device called a hub.</li>
                    <li>Star Network -</li>
                    <li>A star topology is when one machine serves as a central focal point to which all the others are connected.</li>
                </ul>
        </table>
                
        <table>
            <h3>Protocols:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>CSMA/CD Ethernet -</li>
                    <li>The Carrier Sense, Multiple Access with Collision Detection (CSMA/CD) protocol dictates that each message be broadcast to all the machines on the bus topology. Each machine monitors all the messages but keeps only those addressed to itself.</li>
                    <li>CSMA/CA WiFi -</li>
                    <li>Wireless networks adopt the policy of trying to avoid collisions rather than trying to detect them and such policies are classified as Carrier Sense, Multiple Access with Collision Avoidance, many of which are standardized by IEEE within the protocols defined in IEEE 802.11 and commonly referred to as WiFi.</li>
                </ul>
        </table>

        <table>
            <h3>Combing Networks:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Repeater -</li>
                    <li>The repeater is a device that passes signals back and forth between the two original buses (usually with some form of amplification) without considering the meaning of the signals</li>
                    <li>Bridge -</li>
                    <li>A bridge connects two buses but it doesn't pass all the messages across the connection, instead it looks at the destination address that accompanies each message and forwards a message across the connection only when that message is destined for a computer on the other side.</li>
                    <li>Switch -</li>
                    <li>A switch is essentially a bridge with multiple connections allowing it to connect several buses rather than just two. Thus, a switch produces a network consisting of several buses extending from the switch, as spokes on a wheel.</li>
                    <li>Router -</li>
                    <li>Routers are special purpose computers used for forwarding messages and provide links between networks while allowing each network to maintain its unique internal characteristics.</li>
                    <li>Gateway -</li>
                    <li>The point at which one network is linked to an internet is often called a gateway because it serves as a passageway between the network and the outside world.</li>
                </ul>
        </table>

        <table>
            <h3>Client/Server Model:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>P2P: peer-to-peer -</li>
                    <li>Whereas the client/server model involves one process providing a service to numerous others, the P2P model involves processes that provide service to and receive service from each other.</li>
                    <li>Distributed System -</li>
                    <li>Distributed systems consist of software units that execute as processes on different computers.</li>
                    <li>Cloud Computing -</li>
                    <li>Cloud computing, whereby huge pools of shared computers on the network can be allocated for use by clients as needed, is the latest trend in distributed systems.</li>
                </ul>
        </table>

        <table>
            <h3>Internet Addressing:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Tier 1 -</li>
                    <li>Tier-1 ISPs are very high-speed, high-capacity, international WANs and are thought of as the backbone of the Internet.</li>
                    <li>Tier 2 -</li>
                    <li>Tier-2 ISPs tend to be more regional in scope and less potent in their capabilities.</li>
                    <li>Tier 3 -</li>
                    <li>Tier-3 ISPs are essentially an independent Internet, sometimes called an intranet, operated by a single authority that is in the business of supplying Internet access to individual homes and businesses.</li>
                </ul>
        </table>

        <table>
            <h3>IP Address:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>ICANN -<a href = "https://www.icann.org"></a></li>
                    <li>The Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN) awards blocks of consecutively numbered IP addresses ISPs and then they're allowed to allocated the addresses within their awarded blocks to machines.</li>
                    <li>DNS -</li>
                    <li>If a human wants to send a message to a distant machine & identifies the destination by means of a mnemonic address, the software being used must be able to convert that address into an IP address before transmitting the message which is performed with the aid of numerous servers, called name servers, that are essentially directories that provide address translation services to clients. These name servers are used as an Internet-wide directory system known as the domain name system (DNS).</li>
                    <li>TLD: Top-Level Domain</li>
                    <li>Top Level Domains are those used for educational instuitues (.edu), commercial institutions (.com), U.S. government institutions (.gov), non-profit organizations (.org), and military (.mil)</li>
                    <li>Country-Code TLDs - <a href = "https://www.worldstandards.eu/other/tlds/"></a></li>
                    <li>The Internet quickly grew to include countries all over the world resulting in the creation of new two-letter TLDs for each specific country (called country-code TLDs) such as .au for Australia and .ca for Canada</li>
                </ul>
        </table>

        <table>
            <h3>Internet Protocols:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>FTP -</li>
                    <li>The File Transfer Protocol was an application for listing and copying files across the network</li>
                    <li>HTTP -</li>
                    <li>As webservers and browsers have become more sophisticated, more and more of these traditional network applications have come to be handled by webpages via the powerful Hyper Text Transfer Protocol (HTTP).</li>
                    <li>SMTP -</li>
                    <li>Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP) defines a way that two computers on the network may interact when transmitting an email message from one host to the other.</li>
                </ul>
        </table>

        <table>
            <h3>World Wide Web:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>URL -</li>
                    <li>In order to locate and retrieve documents on the Web, each document is given a unique address called a Uniform Resource Locator (URL) which contains the information needed by a browser to contact the proper server and request the desired document.</li>
                    <li>Client-Side Activities -</li>
                    <li>A customer filling out a form and performed by a client are client-side activities.</li>
                    <li>Server-Side Activities -</li>
                    <li>If the activities are performed by the server (such as a webserver) is a server-side activiity.</li>
                </ul>
        </table>

        <table>
            <h3>Internet Four-Layer Software:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Application Layer -</li>
                    <li>The application layer consists of those software units such as clients and servers that use Internet communication to carry out their tasks.</li>
                    <li>Transport Layer -</li>
                    <li>The application layer uses the transport layer to send and receive messages over the Internet in much the same way that you would use a shipping company to send and receive packages. An important task of the transport task is to accept messages from the application layer and to ensure that the messages are properly formatted for transmission over the Internet. The transport layer adds sequence numbers to the small segments it produces so that the segments can be reassembled at the message's destination then it hands these segments, known as packets, to the network layer.</li>
                    <li>Network Layer -</li>
                    <li>It is the network layer's job to decide in which direction a packet should be sent at each step along the packet's path through the Internet, having determined the proper direction, the network layer hands the packet to the link layer for actual transmission.</li>
                    <li>Link Layer -</li>
                    <li>The link layer has the responsibility of transferring the packet. Thus, the link layer must deal with the communication details particular to the individual network in which the computer resides.</li>
                </ul>
        </table>

        <table>
            <h3>Internet Is:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Packet-Switching Network -</li>
                    <li>The Internet is a packet-switched system through which digital data is sent by breaking the data into blocks of bits called packets, which contain both the data being transmitted and control information for routing the data.</li>
                    <li>Fault Tolerant -</li>
                    <li>Routing on the Internet is fault tolerant and redundant</li>
                    <li>Redundant -</li>
                    <li>The redundancy of routing (i.e., more than one way to route data) between two points on the Internet increases the reliability of the Internet and helps it scale to more devices and more people.</li>
                </ul>
        </table>

        <table>
            <h3>Cybersecurity:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Malware -</li>
                    <li>Many attacks incorporate the use of malicious software (collectively called malware). Such software might be transferred to, and executed on, the computer itself, or it might attack the computer from a distance.</li>
                    <li>Virus -</li>
                    <li>A virus is software that infects a computer by inserting itself into programs that already reside in the machine then when the "host" program is executed, the virus is also executed.</li>
                    <li>Worm -</li>
                    <li>A worm is an autonomous program that transfers itself through a network, taking up residence in computers and forwarding copies of itself to other computers.</li>
                    <li>Trojan Horse -</li>
                    <li>A Trojan Horse is a program that enters a computer system disguised as a desirable program, such as a game or useful utility package, that is willingly imported by the victim. Once in the computer, however, the Trojan horse performs additional activities that might have harmful effects.</li>
                    <li>Spyware -</li>
                    <li>Another form of malicious software is spyware (sometimes called sniffing software), which is software that collects information about activities at the computer on which it resides and reports that information back to the instigator of the attack.</li>
                    <li>Phishing -</li>
                    <li>As opposed to obtaining information secretly by sniffing via spyware, phishing is a technique of obtaining information explicitly by simply asking for it. The perpetrator sends email messages posing as a financial institution, a government bureau, or perhaps a law enforcement agency. The email asks the potential victim for information that is supposedly needed for legitimate purposes. However, the information obtained is used by the perpetrator for hostile purposes.</li>
                    <li>DDoS Attack -</li>
                    <li>In contract to suffering from such internal infections as viruses and spyware, a computer in a network can also be attacked by software being executed on other computers in the system. An example is a denial of service (DoS) attack, which is the process of overloading a computer with messages. A DoS attack requires the generation of a large number of messages in a short period of time in order to overwhelm the targeted server. To accomplish this, an attacker usually plants software on numerous unsuspecting computers that'll generate messages when a signal is given. Then, when the signal is given, all of these computers (sometimes called a botnet) swamp the target with messages. When the work of generating the attacks is distributed over many hosts, this is known as a distributed denial of service (DDoS) attack.</li>
                </ul>

        <table>
            <h3>Protection:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Firewall -</li>
                    <li>A primary prevention technique is to filter traffic passing through a point in the network, usually with a program called a firewall. Such firewalls might be designed to block outgoing messages with certain destination address or to block incoming messages from origins that are known to be sources of trouble.</li>
                    <li>Spam Filter -</li>
                    <li>Some variations of firewalls are designed for specific purposes - an example being spam filters, which are firewalls designed to block unwanted email.</li>
                    <li>Proxy Server -</li>
                    <li>Another preventative tool that has filtering conditions is the proxy server which is a software unit that acts as an intermediary between a client and a server with the goal of shielding the client from adverse actions of the server.</li>
                    <li>Antivirus Software -</li>
                    <li>Another means of defense against invasions via network connections is software called antivirus software, which is used to detect and remove the presence of known viruses and other infections.</li>
                    <li>Cryptography -</li>
                    <li>Cryptography is the study of sending and receiving messages securely in the presence of adversaries.</li>
                    <li>Public Key Encryption -</li>
                    <li>One of the more fascinating topics in the field of cryptography is public-key encryption, which involves techniques by which the encryption and decryption algorithms are known, and one of the keys is known, but the encoded message remains secure. A public-key encryption system involves the use of two keys. One key, known as the public key, is used to encrypt messages; the other key, known as the private key, is required to decrypt messages.</li>
