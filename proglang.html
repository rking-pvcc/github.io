            <td>Compiler</td>
            <td>Such a translator was similar to the 2nd-generation assemblers, except that it often had to compile several machine instructions into short sequences to simulate the activity requested by a single high-level primitive. Thus, these translation programs were often called compilers.</td>

        <tr>
            <td>Intrepreter</td>
            <td>An alternative to translators, called interpreters, emerged as another means of implementing third-generation languages. They executed the instructions as they were translated instead of recording the translated version for future use.</td>

            <td>The emergence of a third generation of programming languages that differed from previous generations in that their primitives were both higher level (in that they did not rely on the characteristics of a particular machine) and that they were machine independent (in that they did not rely on the characteristics of a particular machine).</td>

            <td>Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)</td>
            <td>Another programming paradigm is the object-oriented paradigm, which is associated with the programming process called object-oriented programming (OOP). Following this paradigm, a software system is viewed as a collection of units, called objects, each of which is capable of performing the actions that are immediately related to itself as well as requesting actions of other objects.</td>

            <td>In addition to date type, variables in a program are often associated with data structure, which is the conceptual shape or arrangement of data. One common data structure is the array, which is a block of elements of the same type such as a one-dimensional list, a two-dimensional table with rows and columns, or tables with higher dimensions.</td>
